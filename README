for tada2023.org website

internal notes

forking tada2022 didn't work for me
created new repo and followed github documentation for jekyll setup
attempted to pin down versions
mostly worked except
  had to do this for "jekyll serve": bundle add webrick
used github web UI to specify domain name and troubleshoot dns
using "main" branch bcs i find gh-pages branch confusing
