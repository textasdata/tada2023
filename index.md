title: "TADA 2023: New Directions in Analyzing Text as Data"
---

Conference: November 9-10, 2023 at University of Massachusetts Amherst

The New Directions in Analyzing Text as Data (TADA) meeting is a leading forum for interdisciplinary research on the study of politics, society, and culture through computational analysis of documents. Recent advances in NLP have the potential to revolutionize how we study human society. But using these tools effectively, reliably, and equitably requires continuous dialog between experts across computational methods, social sciences, and the humanities.

### Abstract Submissions

TADA 2023 invites applications for research presentations on new work related to text-as-data methods and applications. Our programs from [past meetings](https://textasdata.github.io/events/) (e.g. [2022](https://tada2022.org/)) demonstrate this community's history of bringing together researchers, practitioners, and scholars from many fields.

Proposals to present work are due August 11, and consist of a brief, 300-word abstract in text format rather than a full paper.  TADA 2023 is a non-archival conference; there are no formal proceedings, and papers presented at the conference will not be distributed publicly by the conference. Presenters are expected to provide a paper to their discussant two weeks before the conference. We welcome any work, so long as it hasn't been previously presented at a TADA conference. We also welcome individuals to volunteer to serve as discussants.

### Doctoral Consortium and Broadening Participation

In addition to oral presentations and posters, TADA 2023 will have a doctoral consortium. We have limited funding to cover travel and lodging expenses for PhD students, who will be matched with experienced mentors from complementary fields to offer critiques to specific work and to provide guidance in how to do effective interdisciplinary work.

Additionally, there may be funding available to facilitate participation of attendees for whom it would be a financial burden.  If you would like to be considered for a registration waiver and/or travel funding, please indicate this on the submission.

Diversity leads to stronger science. We actively seek, welcome, and encourage people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities to apply and attend. While many participants have attended TADA for years, we also eagerly welcome new researchers!

The conference organizers are committed to providing accessible and inclusive accommodations for participants. If you have any specific requirements or concerns, please reach out to the organizing committee in advance, and we will make every effort to accommodate your needs.
